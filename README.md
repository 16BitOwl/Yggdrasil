# Yggdrasil

A foray into the world of controlled chaos random world generation for games

## Big notice
This code will most likely not work initially, as it was programmed a couple of years ago and has not seen any updates since then. 
So I will have to go through it all and fix any issues before it will compile.

## Release
There is however still a working realse of this project, which can be downloaded and run on most modern Windows systems.
